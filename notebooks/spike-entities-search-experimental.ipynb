well before Barack Obama was in attendance), she obtained an M.A. in English (history of the English language) at Columbia University. Though she had considerable financial and other support, she declined to complete her work toward a Ph.D., regarding herself more as an artist than a scholar. After her 1966 marriage to Steven Flanders, she had three children, who were brought up in Washington, D.C. and Pelham, New York. \\nAt various times she taught at Clark University, Sarah Lawrence College, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Pittsburgh, among other institutions \\nShe died of cancer on April 12, 2001 after an illness that had begun well before her January 1999 diagnosis. \\nAs many of her poems evidence, she was strongly interested in many of the arts. \\nShe was an excellent pianist and majored in music in college. A memorial plaque at the \"Jane Flanders Nook\" on the Bryn Mawr campus describes her as \"Poet, Musician, Gardener.\"', 'sentParagraphOffsets': [0, 223], 'section': 'Life.', 'title': 'Jane Flanders', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10405769'}), captures={'subject': Span(first=19, last=19), 'object': Span(first=10, last=10)}, highlights=[], continuation_token=OdinsonContinuationToken(prev_doc=1129819, prev_score=0.0))"
